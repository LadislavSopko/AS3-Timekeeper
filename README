This timekeeper is based on the Timekeeper class written by John Dalziel, more info
on which at http://www.computus.org/journal/?p=25

My version of Timekeeper functions like a Timer; unlike the Computus Timekeeper,
it only starts and stops when it is told to. Some functions are provided to improve
its accessibility to calling scripts without overloading it with unnecessary
functionality. I also hope that the more clearly presented script, and removal of
properties that served no purpose in the original Timekeeper, makes life easier for
anyone interested in extending the class further.

Other than that, this is basically an update to Dalziel's original Timekeeper.
Credit where credit's due. In re-programming his Timekeeper I came to understand
more about how it (and, by proxy, EventDispatcher) works, so thanks for that too.
